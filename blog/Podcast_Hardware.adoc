My Linux Audio and Video Setup

With a large amount the workforce going remote, I wanted to share what I am using.

To help fund the projects I work on, the links are Amazon Affiliate links. This will let amazon know I sent you, and give me a small kickback if you buy that product. None of these are sponsorship, they do not get to see what I am saying about the products before I post online. Theses are products that I use and recommend!

If you go with another camera, you will need to check for clean HDMI out.
A great sight to check for that is https://www.elgato.com/en/cam-link/camera-check.

With the Sony A6000 being unavable for the last year and a half, 
and I don't want to spend $2000 on the A7 or FX3,
I found another camera that is just as good.


I am now using a

It does overheat after 2 hours of continues use, verses the Sony a6*00 Cameras.

If you are looking to use a DSLR Camera,
you will have to make sure it supports Clean HDMI.

Currently Testing this card out because it treats the HDMI as UVC which acks as a camera.
So Video Calling, Camera, Mac & Linux all work out of the box.

There are difference power supplies, but DO NOT USE THEM IF THEY ARE NOT 12V at 2A!
